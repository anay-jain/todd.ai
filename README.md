So, managing work and parenting becomes so difficult. This really creates hustle and lack of development in baby’s early stages of development. So, to bridge the gap between parents and their babies need, we propose a solution of real-time monitoring system equipped with ML algorithms for babies and showing useful insights and ready to implement tips that can parents do in real time. So we have divided our real-time system in different modules. One module of this system will detect sleeping patterns of babies and alert the parents when the irregularity of sleep patterns is consistent. Another module will detect radiation level in babies surrounding and hence alert parents if radiation levels are significantly higher. Another module will detect irregularities in sleeping patterns
